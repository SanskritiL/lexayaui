        <p class="subtitle">Stressed about retirement? So are most people. We've put together a simple
        tool to help estimate how much you'll need to retire. Figure out how much you spend in a year,
        and we'll calculate how much you'll need saved to provide for that level of spending.</p>

            <h3>How it works:</h3>
            <p>
                When you invest money in stocks or index funds, you expect your money to grow based on interest over time. For US stocks,
                historical returns have been around 9% per year, with about 6% after inflation.
            </p>
            <p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trinity_study">Trinity Study</a> looked at a wide range of market performance
            over past years, and found that if one withdrew at a 4% rate of their total remaining savings, they would have a very
           low change of running out of money.</p>

           <p>This leads to the helpful rule of thumb:</p>
            <strong>Savings Required = Yearly Spending / Withdrawal Rate</strong>.
            A lower withdrawal rate means you'll need to save more, but it also reduces the risk of running out of money in retirement.
            </p>

            <h3>Assumptions:</h3>
            <ul>
            <li>Your savings are invested in low cost index funds which track the US stock markets (ex: VTI).</li>
            <li>The 4% withdrawal rate is calculated based on 15 to 30 year retirement periods. For longer retirement periods,
            use a lower withdrawal rate to decrease your changes of running out of money.</li>
            <li>The future performance of US stocks will be similar to the past. Not true when
            looking at individual stocks, but surprisingly consistent for an index longer term.</li>
